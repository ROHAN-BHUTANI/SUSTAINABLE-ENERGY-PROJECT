# ⚡ Smart Energy Optimization Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **predictively minimizing energy consumption** in companies by:  
- Forecasting hourly energy demand.  
- Disaggregating usage into categories (HVAC, Lighting, Machines, IT).  
- Optimizing loads using **time-of-use tariffs**.  
- Demonstrating **cost savings & CO₂ emission reductions** through smart scheduling.  

The work is divided into **weekly milestones**.

## 🚀 Week 1 – Baseline Setup  
- Generated **synthetic dataset** of company energy consumption.  
- Features included:  
  - Daily usage (kWh)  
  - Peak/off-peak usage split  
  - Smart appliance ownership  
  - Solar panel adoption  
  - EV ownership  
  - Bill amount + high bill classification  
- Ran exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Built **baseline ML models** for load forecasting & high bill classification.

## 🔋 Week 2 – Load Disaggregation & Optimization  
- Extended dataset with **4 categories**:  
  - HVAC  
  - Lighting  
  - Machines  
  - IT  
- Added **Time-of-Use Tariffs**:  
  - Peak (₹10/kWh, 9AM–6PM)  
  - Mid-Peak (₹7/kWh, 7PM–10PM)  
  - Off-Peak (₹4/kWh, rest of the hours)  
- Applied **Prophet forecasting** for each load category.  
- Designed **Load Shifting Optimization** using PuLP:  
  - 50% of Machines_kWh shiftable.  
  - Shifted to off-peak hours for reduced cost.  
- Calculated:  
  - Baseline vs Optimized Cost  
  - Baseline vs Optimized CO₂ emissions  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Baseline vs Optimized Load (first 2 days).  
  - Cost comparison bar chart.

### ✅ Results (Sample Outputs)  
- 💰 **Cost Savings**: ~15–25%  
- 🌱 **CO₂ Reduction**: proportional to load shifted off-peak

## 📊 Next Steps (Week 3)  
- Add **renewable integration** (solar + battery).  
- Create a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive visualization.  
- Test with **real-world smart meter datasets**.
