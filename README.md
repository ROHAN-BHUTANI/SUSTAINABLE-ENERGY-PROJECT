# ‚ö° Smart Energy Optimization Project  

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on **predictively minimizing energy consumption** in companies by:  
- Forecasting hourly energy demand.  
- Disaggregating usage into categories (HVAC, Lighting, Machines, IT).  
- Optimizing loads using **time-of-use tariffs**.  
- Demonstrating **cost savings & CO‚ÇÇ emission reductions** through smart scheduling.  

The work is divided into **weekly milestones**.

## üöÄ Week 1 ‚Äì Baseline Setup  
- Generated **synthetic dataset** of company energy consumption.  
- Features included:  
  - Daily usage (kWh)  
  - Peak/off-peak usage split  
  - Smart appliance ownership  
  - Solar panel adoption  
  - EV ownership  
  - Bill amount + high bill classification  
- Ran exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Built **baseline ML models** for load forecasting & high bill classification.

## üîã Week 2 ‚Äì Load Disaggregation & Optimization  
- Extended dataset with **4 categories**:  
  - HVAC  
  - Lighting  
  - Machines  
  - IT  
- Added **Time-of-Use Tariffs**:  
  - Peak (‚Çπ10/kWh, 9AM‚Äì6PM)  
  - Mid-Peak (‚Çπ7/kWh, 7PM‚Äì10PM)  
  - Off-Peak (‚Çπ4/kWh, rest of the hours)  
- Applied **Prophet forecasting** for each load category.  
- Designed **Load Shifting Optimization** using PuLP:  
  - 50% of Machines_kWh shiftable.  
  - Shifted to off-peak hours for reduced cost.  
- Calculated:  
  - Baseline vs Optimized Cost  
  - Baseline vs Optimized CO‚ÇÇ emissions  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Baseline vs Optimized Load (first 2 days).  
  - Cost comparison bar chart.

### ‚úÖ Results (Sample Outputs)  
- üí∞ **Cost Savings**: ~15‚Äì25%  
- üå± **CO‚ÇÇ Reduction**: proportional to load shifted off-peak

## üìå Week 3: Final Submission
- Completed full Smart Energy Optimization project.  
- Finalized models for demand prediction, load optimization, and cost analysis.  
- Generated visualizations for baseline vs optimized load.  
- Submitted complete notebook: [`fED-beo.ipynb`](Week3_FinalSubmission/Fed-BEO.ipynb)
